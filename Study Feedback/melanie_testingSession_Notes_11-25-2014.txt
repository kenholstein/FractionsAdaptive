#11 (video)—the large red title for this problem says “If 2 fractions have different numerators and 

denominators, could they actually be the same number?  Let’s find out!”  But the 2 fractions in the 

problem are not equivalent (2/3 and 3/6).  I was primed to learn about when 2 fractions look different 

but then they are actually the same, so I was sort of confused.   I’d change the 2 fractions in the problem 

to actually be equivalent.  Otherwise change the wording of the title to something else—like “figuring 

out if 2 fractions are different”…..



2. I think that most of the fill-in-the blank sections are confusing.  Additionally it is my opinion that 

these sections are not of much (if any) value pedagogically—at best, if students already 

understand the concepts, this section might reinforce their knowledge a bit (if they are not 

confused by the task itself); however if students struggle at all with understanding  the 

concepts, this section will not help them to learn.  I know the concepts well but had difficulty 

figuring out some of the ‘right’ words for the blanks.  Quite frustrating.


#16—2.  In the drag/drop words for the fill in blank, see “greatest common fact”  (letters omitted)



#17 (video)—1.  Fill in the blank is confusing—you have to read the whole sentence before you can then 

go back to fill anything in….”When we make 4/6 on the number line, we have ________ total sections, 

compared to when we make 2/3.  However the sections are ________.  This means that each fraction is 

the same ________ .” etc.  In my opinion not of value pedagogically.



#18 (video)— Again, I found the fill in the blank to be quite confusing.  The talk of “size of the sections” doesn’t register 

immediately for me.









#19 (no video)—question—is it intentional that students have to do all of the math calculations in their 

head on this?  The hints are not particularly helpful---they talk about “writing” and “re-writing” the 

fractions so they can be added (they have diff denoms), but there is no space/place to do this except in 

my head.







#27 (video)---  The fill in the blank last sentence is very tricky—you have 

to read entire sentence and then go backwards to complete the blanks.   “When there are _____sections 

in the unit and a point is plotted ______sections to the right of zero, this point represents fraction 

___________.  This will be very tricky for kids (and in my opinion not of pedagogical value).





#28 (video)—again (like problem #11) the title does not match the fractions in the problem:  The title is 

“if 2 fractions have different numerators and denominators, can they actually be the same?  Let’s find 

out!”  But the fractions have the same numerator—they  are 2/3 and 2/4.    Again, I find the fill-in blank 

section confusing.
